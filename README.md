Uncle Bob Clean Code examples using JavaScript and TypeScript

The purpose of this repo is for me to see if modern practices in JavaScript and TypeScript still apply to Clean Code. Also, this is a learning exercise.

Each Chapter is broken down into page number folders. Inside each folder is a JavaScript and TypeScript recreation(to the best of my ability) of the Clean Code Java examples. The examples should be the in same order as the book.

I am also trying to prevent TypeScript compiler errors so there could be a bit more code in each example.
